h1. Domain Class Usage

A domain class fulfills the M in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and represents a persistent entity that is mapped onto an underlying database table. In Grails a domain is a class that lives in the @grails-app/domain@ directory. A domain class can be created with the [create-domain-class|commandLine] command:

{code:java}
grails create-domain-class org.bookstore.Book
{code}

or with your favourite IDE or text editor.

{code:java}
package org.bookstore

class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    Author author
}
{code}

The class name, by default, is mapped to the table name in lower case and separated by underscores instead of camel case. Each property maps to individual columns.

Refer to the user guide section on [GORM|guide:GORM] for more information.
