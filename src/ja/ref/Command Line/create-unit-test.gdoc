A unit test differs from an integration test in that the Grails environment is not loaded for each test execution and it is left up to you to perform the appropriate mocking using GroovyMock or a Mock library such as "EasyMock":http://www.easymock.org/.

Refer to the section on [Unit Testing|guide:testing] of the user guide for information on unit vs. integration testing.
