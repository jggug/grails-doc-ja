h1. sort

h2. Purpose

Customizes the default property to sort by for query results.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
class Book {
    ...
    static mapping = {
        sort "releaseDate"
    }
}
{code}

h2. Description

Usage: @sort(string/map)@

By default results are sorted by creation date, and you can specify the column to order by in a query:

{code}
def results = Book.list(sort:"title")
{code}

However, you can also configure the default sort property:

{code}
static mapping = {
    sort "title"
}
{code}

in which case the @sort@ argument is no longer needed. You can also control the sort order:

{code}
static mapping = {
    sort title: "desc" // or "asc"
}
{code}
