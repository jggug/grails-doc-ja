h1. findOrCreateWhere

h2. Purpose

Uses named arguments that match the property names of the domain class to produce a query that returns the first result.  This method behaves just like [findWhere|domainClasses] except that it will never return @null@.  If a matching instance cannot be found then a new instance will be created, populated with values from the query parameters and returned.  The difference between this method and [findOrSaveWhere|domainClasses] is that this method will not save a newly created instance where [findOrSaveWhere|domainClasses] does.

h2. Examples

Given the domain class:

{code:java}
class Book {

   String title
   Date releaseDate
   String author

   static constraints = {
      releaseDate nullable: true
   }
}
{code}

You can query in the form:

{code:java}
def book = Book.findOrCreateWhere(author: "Stephen King", title: "The Stand")
{code}

h2. Description

Parameters:

* @queryParams@ - A @Map@ of key/value pairs to be used in the query. If no matching instance is found then this data is used to initialize a new instance.
