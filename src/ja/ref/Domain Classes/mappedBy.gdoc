h1. mappedBy

h2. Purpose

The @mappedBy@ static property adds the ability to change how a bidirectional association is linked

h2. Examples

{code:java}
class Airport {

    static mappedBy = [outgoingFlights: 'departureAirport',
                       incomingFlights: 'destinationAirport']

    static hasMany = [outgoingFlights: Route,
                      incomingFlights: Route]
}
{code}

{code:java}
class Route {
    Airport departureAirport
    Airport destinationAirport
}
{code}

In this example the @Airport@ class defines two bidirectional one-to-many associations. Without defining @mappedBy@ this is impossible as GORM cannot differentiate which of the two properties on the other end of the association (either @departureAirport@ or @destinationAirport@ in the @Route@ class) each one-to-many should be associated with.

The solution is to define @mappedBy@ which tells the @Airport@ class how each association relates to the other side.
