Grails uses [JIRA|http://jira.grails.org] to track issues in both the core framework, its documentation, its website, and in many of the public plugins. If you’ve found a bug or wish to see a particular feature added, this is the place to start. You’ll need to create a (free) JIRA account in order to either submit an issue or comment on an existing one.

When submitting issues, please provide as much information as possible and in the case of bugs, make sure you explain which versions of Grails and various plugins you are using. Also, an issue is much more likely to be dealt with if you attach a reproducible sample application (which can be packaged up using the @grails bug-report@ command).
