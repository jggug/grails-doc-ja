By default, tags are added to the default Grails namespace and are used with the @g:@ prefix in GSP pages. However, you can specify a different namespace by adding a static property to your @TagLib@ class:

{code:java}
class SimpleTagLib {
    static namespace = "my"

    def example = { attrs ->
        ...
    }
}
{code}

Here we have specified a @namespace@ of @my@ and hence the tags in this tag lib must then be referenced from GSP pages like this:

{code:xml}
<my:example name="..." />
{code}

where the prefix is the same as the value of the static @namespace@ property. Namespaces are particularly useful for plugins.

Tags within namespaces can be invoked as methods using the namespace as a prefix to the method call:

{code:java}
out << my.example(name:"foo")
{code}

This works from GSP, controllers or tag libraries
