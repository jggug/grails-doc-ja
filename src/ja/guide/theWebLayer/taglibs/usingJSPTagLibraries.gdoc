In addition to the simplified tag library mechanism provided by GSP, you can also use JSP tags from GSP. To do so simply declare the JSP to use with the @taglib@ directive:

{code:xml}
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %>
{code}

Then you can use it like any other tag:

{code:xml}
<fmt:formatNumber value="${10}" pattern=".00"/>
{code}

With the added bonus that you can invoke JSP tags like methods:

{code:java}
${fmt.formatNumber(value:10, pattern:".00")}
{code}
