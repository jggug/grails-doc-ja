Although Grails [controllers|guide:controllers] support fine grained interceptors, these are only really useful when applied to a few controllers and become difficult to manage with larger applications. Filters on the other hand can be applied across a whole group of controllers, a URI space or to a specific action. Filters are far easier to plugin and maintain completely separately to your main controller logic and are useful for all sorts of cross cutting concerns such as security, logging, and so on.
