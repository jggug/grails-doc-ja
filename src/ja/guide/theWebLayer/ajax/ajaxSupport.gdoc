By default Grails ships with the "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ library, but through the [Plugin system|guide:plugins] provides support for other frameworks such as [Prototype|http://www.prototypejs.org/], [Dojo:http://dojotoolkit.org/], [Yahoo UI:http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/] and the [Google Web Toolkit|http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/].

This section covers Grails' support for Ajax in general. To get started, add this line to the @<head>@ tag of your page:

{code:xml}
<g:javascript library="jquery" />
{code}

You can replace @jQuery@ with any other library supplied by a plugin you have installed. This works because of Grails' support for adaptive tag libraries. Thanks to Grails' plugin system there is support for a number of different Ajax libraries including (but not limited to):

* jQuery
* Prototype
* Dojo
* YUI
* MooTools
