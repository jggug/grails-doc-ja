An HTML form can also be submitted asynchronously in one of two ways. Firstly using the [formRemote|tags] tag which expects similar attributes to those for the [remoteLink|tags] tag:

{code:xml}
<g:formRemote url="[controller: 'book', action: 'delete']"
              update="[success: 'message', failure: 'error']">
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="1" />
    <input type="submit" value="Delete Book!" />
</g:formRemote >
{code}

Or alternatively you can use the [submitToRemote|tags] tag to create a submit button. This allows some buttons to submit remotely and some not depending on the action:

{code:xml}
<form action="delete">
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="1" />
    <g:submitToRemote action="delete"
                      update="[success: 'message', failure: 'error']" />
</form>
{code}
