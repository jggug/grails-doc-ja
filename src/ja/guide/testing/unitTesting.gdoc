Unit testing are tests at the "unit" level. In other words you are testing individual methods or blocks of code without consideration for surrounding infrastructure. Unit tests are typically run without the presence of physical resources that involve I/O such databases, socket connections or files. This is to ensure they run as quick as possible since quick feedback is important.

Since Grails 2.0, a collection of unit testing mixins is provided by Grails that lets you enhance the behavior of a typical JUnit 3, JUnit 4 or Spock test. The following sections cover the usage of these mixins.

{note}
The previous JUnit 3-style @GrailsUnitTestCase@ class hierarchy is still present in Grails for backwards compatibility, but is now deprecated. The previous documentation on the subject can be found in the [Grails 1.3.x documentation|http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/guide/9.%20Testing.html]
{note}

You won't normally have to import any of the testing classes because Grails does that for you. But if you find that your IDE for example can't find the classes, here they all are:

* @grails.test.mixin.TestFor@
* @grails.test.mixin.TestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.Mock@
* @grails.test.mixin.support.GrailsUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.domain.DomainClassUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.services.ServiceUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.web.ControllerUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.web.FiltersUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.web.GroovyPageUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.web.UrlMappingsUnitTestMixin@
* @grails.test.mixin.webflow/WebFlowUnitTestMixin@

Note that you're only ever likely to use the first two explicitly. The rest are there for reference.
