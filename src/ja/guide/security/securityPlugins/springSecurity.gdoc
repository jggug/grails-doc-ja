The Spring Security plugins are built on the [Spring Security|http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/] project which provides a flexible, extensible framework for building all sorts of authentication and authorization schemes. The plugins are modular so you can install just the functionality that you need for your application. The Spring Security plugins are the official security plugins for Grails and are actively maintained and supported.

There is a [Core plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core] which supports form-based authentication, encrypted/salted passwords, HTTP Basic authentication, etc. and secondary dependent plugins provide alternate functionality such as [OpenID authentication|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-openid], [ACL support|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-acl], [single sign-on with Jasig CAS|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-cas], [LDAP authentication|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-ldap], [Kerberos authentication|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-kerberos], and a plugin providing [user interface extensions|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-ui] and security workflows.

See the [Core plugin page|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core] for basic information and the [user guide|http://burtbeckwith.github.com/grails-spring-security-core/] for detailed information.
